# Robot Docs

> Workstation setup documentation for robotics simulation and development with Isaac Sim, Isaac ROS, and Unitree G1.

## Getting Started

- [Quick Start](getting-started/index.md): Introduction to the system -- what everything is, how it connects, and where to go next.
- [Architecture](getting-started/architecture.md): System architecture diagrams for simulation and real G1 robot modes, data flow, DDS config.

## Simulation

### Isaac Sim

- [Isaac Sim Setup](simulation/isaac-sim/setup.md): Isaac Sim 5.1 and Isaac Lab installation, ROS 2 bridge, Foxglove visualization, troubleshooting.

### Isaac ROS

- [Isaac ROS Container](simulation/isaac-ros/container.md): GPU-accelerated ROS 2 perception container (AprilTag, cuVSLAM, nvblox), FastDDS config, foxglove-bridge.
- [Isaac ROS Dockerfile](simulation/isaac-ros/dockerfile.md): Reproducible Dockerfile plan for the Isaac ROS container.
